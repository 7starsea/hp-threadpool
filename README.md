We have specific application (high-frequency trading system) in mind for designing the HPThreadPool. 
Common Features:

 * It is highly scalable and fast.
 * It is header only.
 * No external dependencies, only standard library needed (C++11).

# How to use
You only need to include file **hp-threadpool.hpp** in your project, see also **example.cpp**.

# Extra Contribution
We also provide a **high_resolution_timer.h** for benchmark testing.
